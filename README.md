You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate your observation. In the workflow described earlier, the changes from the release branch should indeed be merged into both the `develop` branch and the `master` (or `main`) branch.

Here's the revised set of steps to include the merge into the master branch:

### 1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my_calculator_project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my_calculator_project
```

### 2. Initialize a Git repository:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a README file
echo "# Calculator Project" >> README.md

# Add README to the staging area
git add README.md

# Commit the initial changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
```

### 3. Create a feature branch for addition operation:

```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch for addition
git checkout -b feature/addition
```

Implement the addition operation in your code.

### 4. Commit changes:

```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented addition operation"
```

### 5. Switch back to the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`):

```bash
git checkout develop
```

### 6. Merge the feature branch into the development branch:

```bash
# Merge the feature branch into the development branch
git merge feature/addition
```

### 7. Repeat steps 3-6 for other features (subtraction, multiplication, division).

### 8. When ready for a release, create a release branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to a release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

### 9. Run integration tests, update version, changelog, commit changes:

```bash
# Run integration tests

# Update version and changelog
# (manually edit files or use tools like bumpversion)
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version for release 1.0.0"
```

### 10. Switch back to the development branch and merge the release branch:

```bash
# Switch to the development branch
git checkout develop

# Merge the release branch into the development branch
git merge release/1.0.0
```

### 11. Switch to the master branch and merge the release branch:

```bash
# Switch to the master branch
git checkout master

# Merge the release branch into the master branch
git merge release/1.0.0
```

### 12. Tag the release:

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"
```

### 13. Optionally, delete the release branch:

```bash
# Delete the release branch
git branch -d release/1.0.0
```
