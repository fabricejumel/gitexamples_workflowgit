The goal of the revised workflow is to establish a simplified branching model for a project, where features are developed on separate branches, integrated into a development branch (`develop`), and eventually released to a master branch (`master`). Here are the key goals:

1. **Initialize a Project:**
   - Set up a new project with a README file and an initial commit.

2. **Feature Development:**
   - Create feature branches for each new feature (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   - Develop and test features on their respective branches.
   - Merge feature branches into the development branch (`develop`) once features are complete.

3. **Release Management:**
   - Create a release branch when features are ready for a new version.
   - Run integration tests and update version information in preparation for release.
   - Merge the release branch into both the development (`develop`) and master (`master`) branches.

4. **Version Tagging:**
   - Tag the release with a version number for tracking and reference.

5. **Optional Cleanup:**
   - Optionally, delete the release branch after merging.

By following this workflow, you maintain a clear separation between ongoing development (`develop` branch) and stable releases (`master` branch). It's a simplified alternative to Git Flow, with a linear progression of features from development to release. Adjust the steps based on your project's needs and preferences.
Here's the revised set of steps to include the merge into the master branch:

### 1. Initialize a new project:

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my_calculator_project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my_calculator_project
```

### 2. Initialize a Git repository:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a README file
echo "# Calculator Project" >> README.md

# Add README to the staging area
git add README.md

# Commit the initial changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
```

### 3. Create a feature branch for addition operation:

```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch for addition
git checkout -b feature/addition
```

Implement the addition operation in your code.

### 4. Commit changes:

```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented addition operation"
```

### 5. Switch back to the main development branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`):

```bash
git checkout develop
```

### 6. Merge the feature branch into the development branch:

```bash
# Merge the feature branch into the development branch
git merge feature/addition
```

### 7. Repeat steps 3-6 for other features (subtraction, multiplication, division).

### 8. When ready for a release, create a release branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to a release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
```

### 9. Run integration tests, update version, changelog, commit changes:

```bash
# Run integration tests

# Update version and changelog
# (manually edit files or use tools like bumpversion)
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version for release 1.0.0"
```

### 10. Switch back to the development branch and merge the release branch:

```bash
# Switch to the development branch
git checkout develop

# Merge the release branch into the development branch
git merge release/1.0.0
```

### 11. Switch to the master branch and merge the release branch:

```bash
# Switch to the master branch
git checkout master

# Merge the release branch into the master branch
git merge release/1.0.0
```

### 12. Tag the release:

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"
```

### 13. Optionally, delete the release branch:

```bash
# Delete the release branch
git branch -d release/1.0.0
```
